Usage of Abstract Factory Design Pattern in Java

1. When the system needs to be independent of how its objects are created, composed, and represented.

2. When the system is configured with one of multiple families of objects.

3. When the family of related product objects is designed to be used together, and you need to enforce this constraint.
